# Link-Cleaner
"You are sharing URLs with Tracking Links. Please stop." 
> Built for privacy, vibe coded in Google Antigravity.

📖 About The Project

Link-Cleaner is a simple, no-nonsense web tool designed to strip invasive tracking identifiers from the links you share.

We’ve all seen them—those incredibly long URLs filled with ?fbclid=, ?utm_source=, and other nonsense attached to the end of a link. These "identifiers" exist to track your activity across the web. This project restores your privacy (and the aesthetics of your links) by surgically removing that "noise" while keeping the destination intact.

The inspiration for this tool comes from the article "You are sharing URLs with Tracking Links. Please stop" by Ian Darwin

✨ Features
Instant Cleaning: Paste a dirty link, get a clean one instantly.

Privacy First: Removes fbclid, gclid, utm_content, and other common tracking parameters.

Lightweight: No bloat, just pure URL sanitization.

🤖 How It Was Built: Vibe Coding
This project was not written line-by-line in a traditional editor. It was Vibe Coded using Google Antigravity (powered by Gemini 3).

Instead of obsessing over syntax, the development process involved "forgetting the code exists" and collaborating with AI agents through natural language prompts. The result is a functional, modern application generated purely from the vibe and intent of the privacy requirements.

🚀 Usage
Copy a link with tracking parameters (e.g., example.com?fbclid=123xyz...).

Paste it into the input box on the site.

Click Clean.

Copy, Share or Open your fresh, tracking-free URL.
